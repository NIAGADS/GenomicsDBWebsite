        text: 'If variants were identified by dbSNP refSNP IDs, GRCh38/hg38 coordinates are determined by mapping the refSNP identifier against the GenomicsDB variant reference set for GRCh37/hg19, with checks made for deprecated or synonymized rsIDs. In all other cases a two-stage lift over process was used.  A bed file capturing GRCh37 variant coordinates was generated for each dataset, which was then run through the UCSC Genome Browser liftOver script. Any unmapped or non-uniquely mapped variants were then submitted to the NCBI coordinate remapping service (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/tools/remap" target="_blank">Remap</a>). Any features left unmapped were dropped, as well as long-indels, which were not lifted over from GRCh37/hg19 to GRCh38/hg38 as there any lift over would have low confidence that the full sequence was conserved; that the allele sequences are most likely no longer valid on the newer assembly'

        text: 'Linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure for 1000 Genomes super populations (GRCh37/hg19: phase 3 version 1 [11 May 2011] ; GRCh38/hg38: 1000 Genomes 30x ) were estimated using <a href="https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/" target="_blank">PLINK v1.90b2i 64-bit</a>. Only LD-scores with r<sup>2</sup> â‰¥ 0.2 are stored in the GenomicsDB. Also available are LD-estimates for the European (non-Hispanic white) subset of the ADSP R3 17k whole genome sequencing (WGS) samples. These were calculated using <a href="https://github.com/statgen/emeraLD" target="_blank">emeraLD</a>. Updated LD estimates for ADSP populations will be made available along with future releases of ADSP variants called from WGS. ADSP WGS results are not available for GRCh37/hg19'
